# Roblox API Simplifier
This repository is coded in Typescript and is fully self-coded by me (kkeyy)
The purpose of this is:
- To be able to fetch all roblox users (including thumbnails) by fragments of the provided username
- To be able to fetch all public experiences (including thumbnails) by the provided username

I have coded this for a project of mine, which I do not wanna reveal.
I made this public so users who might have same ideas and need something like this can freely use it.

# Usage
1. Open Terminal (Make sure you have node installed)
2. Run 'npm install'
3. Run 'npm start'

# Dependencies
This repository uses express, eslint and node-fetch
